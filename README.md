## A/B Testing in Cookie Cats Game

Mini project using Python for statistical analysis.

__Introduction__ <br>
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game whereby players clear tasks and level up. After certain number of levels, players will encounter gates which force them to either wait for sometime or make in-game purchases to be able to play further.   

__Business Problem__ <br>
Despite growing popularity and more players subscribing to the game, in-game purchases revenue and total number of active players have been declining over time with players uninstalling the game after playing for few days. 

__Business Objective__ <br>
Increase YoY in-game purchases revenue by increasing gamers' retention rate

__Hypothesis__ <br>
Cookie Cats CEO believes players are churning because first gate encounter at level 30 is too early.
To increase retention rate, game developers ran A/B test by moving first gate from level 30 to level 40 for some players.
